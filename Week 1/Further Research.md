# üìå Week 1 - Extra Research  
*__Since week doesn't have a lab, I wanted to fill in the gaps using extra research to show I still did a labs worth of work.__*

## üåç 1. How Networks & Operating Systems Shape Modern Computing  

It's crucial to have synergy between networks and operating systems - for the functionality of modern devices. From cloud computing to cybersecurity, networks and operating systems play a primary and pivotal role in **seamless communication and data management**.

### The Backbone of the Internet: How Data Travels  
- **Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching:**  
  - **Packet switching** is used in the Internet to allow **efficient data transfer** without dedicated connections.  
  - **Circuit switching** is used in traditional phone systems where **a dedicated line is reserved** throughout the call.  
  - **Why does packet switching dominate?** More users can share the network simultaneously.  

- **IP Addressing and Routing**  
  - Every device connected to the Internet needs a **unique IP address** to send and receive data.  
  - **IPv4 vs IPv6:**  
    - IPv4 has a limited number of addresses (4.3 billion).  
    - IPv6 expands the addressing capacity, solving the **IP exhaustion problem**.  

### Cloud Computing & OS Integration  
- Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure rely on OS-managed virtual networks.  
- Operating Systems in the Cloud:
  - Linux dominates cloud environments due to its **security, flexibility, and performance**.  
  - Windows Server is commonly used for **enterprise applications and Active Directory services**.

## 3. The Future of Networking: Emerging Trends  

### 5G & Edge Computing  
- 5G is the next-gen network technology that enables **faster, lower-latency connections**.  
- Edge Computing brings processing closer to users, reducing latency for applications like **self-driving cars & IoT devices**.  

### Quantum Networking  
- A **quantum internet** could revolutionize security using **quantum encryption**, making hacking nearly impossible.  

### Software-Defined Networking (SDN)  
- SDN allows **network administrators to control traffic via software** instead of hardware configurations, making networks **more adaptable and scalable**.
