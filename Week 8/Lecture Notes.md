# Week 8 - Commonly Used OS

> As the titles suggests this weeks notes mainly goes over commonly used operating systems


## Intro to OSs
- **What is an Operating System (OS)?**
  - > An OS is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between applications and hardware.
- **Functions of an OS:**
  - **Process Management**: Handles the scheduling and execution of processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocates and deallocates memory to programs.
- **File System Management**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
- **Device Management**: Controls hardware devices like printers, keyboards, and displays.
- **User Interface**: Provides a way for users to interact with the system, either through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).

## Introduction to Android Operating System
- Linux-based mobile operating system developed by Google.
- Dominant mobile OS globally.
- Open-source, highly customizable.
- Designed for touchscreen mobile devices.
- A Linux-based system originally designed for mobile phones.
- The most popular mobile OS.
- Development was done by Android Inc., which was bought by Google in 2005.
- 1st commercial version (Android 1.0) was released in 2008.
- Most recent version is Android 16.0 (Baklava).
- Android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system.
- The open-source nature of Android has been the key to its success.

### Android Architecture
- **Kernel**: Linux kernel at the base.
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Interface between hardware and software.
- **Android Runtime (ART)**: Executes Android applications.
- **Framework**: Provides APIs for app development.

### Android App Development

### Android Security Features
- **Google Play Protect**: Malware scanning.
- **App sandboxing**: Isolates apps for security.
- **Encryption**: Data protection.
- **Permissions**: User control over app access.

## Pros & Cons of Android
- **Pros**:
  - Wide range of devices.
  - Open-source.
  - Highly customizable.
  - Large app ecosystem.
- **Cons**:
  - Fragmentation (different versions and devices).
  - Potential security vulnerabilities.
  - Bloatware from manufacturers.

## Android Runtime (ART)
- Most Android software is mapped into a bytecode format which is then transformed into native instructions on the device itself.
- Earlier releases of Android used a scheme known as Dalvik, however Dalvik has a number of limitations in terms of scaling up to larger memories and multicore architectures.
- More recent releases of Android rely on a scheme known as Android runtime (ART).
- ART is fully compatible with Dalvikâ€™s existing bytecode format so application developers do not need to change their coding to be executable under ART.
- Each Android application runs in its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik VM.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of ART
- **Advantages**
  - Reduces startup time of applications as native code is directly executed.
  - Improves battery life because processor usage for JIT is avoided.
  - Lesser RAM footprint is required for the application to run as there is no storage required for JIT cache.
  - There are a number of Garbage Collection optimizations and debug enhancements that went into ART.
- **Disadvantages**
  - Because the conversion from bytecode to native code is done at install time, application installation takes more time.
  - On the first fresh boot or first boot after factory reset, all applications installed on a device are compiled to native code using dex2opt, therefore the first boot can take significantly longer to reach Home Screen compared to Dalvik.
  - The native code thus generated is stored on internal storage that requires a significant amount of additional internal storage space.
